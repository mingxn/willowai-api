# Willow.ai: Core Feature Breakdown
This document outlines the inputs and outputs for the three core features of the Willow.ai application.

1. AI Plant Doctor
This feature acts as an on-demand expert to diagnose and solve plant health issues.

User Input:

A photograph of the affected plant part (e.g., a discolored leaf, a stem with pests).

System Output:

Diagnosis: A clear identification of the problem (e.g., "Powdery Mildew," "Spider Mite Infestation," or "Nitrogen Deficiency").

Action Plan: A simple, step-by-step guide detailing the treatment required to solve the diagnosed issue.

2. Personal Care Assistant
This feature automates and simplifies the ongoing task of plant care through smart scheduling and reminders.

User Input:

The user adds a specific plant to their "digital collection" within the app.

(Implicitly) The app uses the device's location to access local weather data.

System Output:

Dynamic Care Schedule: An automatically generated calendar for watering, fertilizing, and other care tasks, tailored to that specific plant's needs.

Smart Alerts: Context-aware notifications that adjust based on real-time conditions (e.g., "Heat wave today, check your plant's soil for dryness," instead of a generic "Water your plant" reminder).

3. Green Space Planner
This feature helps users discover the ideal plants for their specific environment and aesthetic preferences.

User Input:

Answers to a short questionnaire covering:

Environmental conditions (e.g., light exposure, humidity).

User's experience level (e.g., "Beginner," "Experienced").

Desired aesthetic or style.

System Output:

Plant Recommendations: A curated list of the top 3 plants guaranteed to thrive in the user's conditions.

AR Visualization: An Augmented Reality view, allowing the user to place a virtual model of the recommended plant into their physical space using their phone's camera.
